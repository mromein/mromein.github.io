  Proof of concept for a virtual production performance workflow with a person in a virtual reality headset acting as a puppeteer.
  
  <br><br>

  The puppeteer is moving and puppetting the avatars while the two performers are controlling the avatars faces using iPhones and face motion capture. The camera cuts are being triggered by a technician off camera. All of these elements combine in real time to create a performance on a virtual stage which is visible to the audience through projection on the back wall.
