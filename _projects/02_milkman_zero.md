description: >
  MILKMAN ZERO is a theater performance combining text-based computer games, human-computer interaction, and psychological horror. A performer plays a video game about delivering milk, only to discover they're participating in a carefully orchestrated descent into cosmic dread examining AI, labor, and systematic violence.
