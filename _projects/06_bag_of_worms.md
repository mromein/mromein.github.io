description: >
  An investigation into the anatomy of a famous video game character. A tyrannical disembodied head leading his friends through a series of unnerving experiments. A meditation on all the Sims we left to die on our parentâ€™s desktop computer. 
  <br><br>
  Bag of Worms is an irreverent grab bag of Looney Tunes violence and recycled intellectual properties in which artist Matt Romein uses motion capture suits to project performers into a video game of his own making. As the audience watches, their grasp on what's real and what's virtual begins to slip. For a generation nurtured on a diet of simulated violence: what is their threshold for this digital onslaught, and what happens when they reach their breaking point?
