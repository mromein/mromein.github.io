  <i>Meat Puppet Arcade</i> is a series of experiments that examine our relationship to digital representations of physical bodies. As computer graphics become hyper realistic and 3D scanning technology becomes mainstream, there is a greater need to consider the ramifications of how digital bodies are treated. Romein uses a nude 3D scan of his own body to create video games, installations, and video pieces that ask the viewer questions to consider consent, violence, autonomy, and the representation of identity.
