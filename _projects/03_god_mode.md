  It’s a Special Little Boy’s birthday! He’s turning 2nd grade. But all his family wants to talk about is Marcello, the newest member of the family. If he wants to have the best birthday ever, it looks like it’s up to him to make it happen.

  God Mode is a live cinema theater experiment merging video game engines, facial motion capture, and digital avatars with live performance.
