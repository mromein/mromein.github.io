  In Piehole's SKI END, an abandoned ski shop becomes the center of the universe. A group of 30-whatever urbanites finds itself stuck in a flood-damaged building with a makeshift skate ramp, dead birds, and the tattered banner of a final blowout sale. From these clues they ritualistically reanimate a bygone world of Ski, until they incite a cosmic force. Rising from the ruins of economic and environmental dread, Pieholeâ€™s SKI END examines chronic patterns of apocalyptic despair and what it takes to face The Sublime.
