  FOMO:DIPTYCH is a densely layered performance installation to study the diptych: as a form, a way of viewing, listening, feeling, and consuming. A place where missing something is guaranteed (and ok). <br><br> FOMO:DIPTYCH asks if performance – as an inherently ephemeral experience – can help us recognize our capacity to hold multiple perspectives at once, and when considered collectively, reveals the cacophonous jumble of inputs we piece together to make meaning. Our eyes move independently of the eyes of our neighbor, each of our brains collecting only the objects we choose to let in. And where we sit affects what we encounter. <br><br> Grab a drink. Write notes for your next great novel on a bar napkin (pens provided). Thank you for being here with us.
