  <i>When you were partying I studied The Blade
  When you were having premarital sex
  I mastered THE BLOCKCHAIN
  While you wasted your days at the gym in pursuit of vanity
  I cultivated Inner Strength
  And now that the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate you have the audacity to come to me for help?</i>
