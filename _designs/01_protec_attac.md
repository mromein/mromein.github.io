_When you were partying I studied The Blade
When you were having premarital sex
I mastered THE BLOCKCHAIN
While you wasted your days at the gym in pursuit of vanity
I cultivated Inner Strength
And now that the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate you have the audacity to come to me for help?_

This is a comedy show.
