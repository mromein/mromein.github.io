description: >
  Knot In My Name is a multimedia performance work that explores the intersections of Ita Segevâ€™s personal and sociopolitical contexts as an anti-Zionist Israeli trans woman immigrating to the U.S.<br><br>Weaving together text, movement, elaborate sound and video design, biting humor, many characters and even more costume changes, this piece is an invitation to experience the necessary heartbreak that comes from confronting the huge gaps between the reality and narratives we are taught about the body and place we are born into.<br><br>By letting go of what never really belonged to us, we might create the space for reclaiming what does.
