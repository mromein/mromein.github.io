  Performance collective Piehole, helmed by director Tara Ahmadinejad, teamed up with sound artist/composer Lea Bertucci to wake up an expensive art-object and give it a workout in a surreal gymnasium of sound, video, dance, and sweat. Inspired by an enigmatic art-book produced from an awkward one-off collaboration between Samuel Beckett and Jasper Johns, Pieholeâ€™s HAND FOOT FIZZLE FACE examines the self-defeating impulse to transcend ephemerality, in art and life.
