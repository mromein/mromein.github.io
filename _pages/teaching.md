  - title: "Live Image Processing and Performance"
    description: This course teaches the ins and outs of using imagery in real-time within a performance context. The class will use OBS and MaxMSPJitter to study various ways of manipulating visual media (video, still imagery, live camera feeds) in integration with various interactive elements (sound, physical interfaces, sensors) in order to create dynamic and replicable performance systems with a focus on remote and online spaces. <br> <br> We will look at ways in which images are represented by a computer in order to increase our understanding of these systems and expand our visual/digital palette. We will then apply that understanding to a variety of different performance formats and contexts while discussing strategies and techniques for creating compelling performances.Students will be assigned short solo and duet performances based on the ideas of computer desktops, text, and cell phones as well as a group project based on practices found in object theater & experimental animation. The final project will a collaboratively online TV show called LIPP TV hosted and produced by the instructor and presented as a live performance to the public.
